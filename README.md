# PyFileManager
A way to mass move files using Python!

<h2>What is PyFileManager</h2>
<p>PyFileManager uses Python without dependencies to CRUD your files in a variety of ways! As of right now PyFileManager can move all files of a specific extension (ex ".html"), regardless of how deep it is inside other subdirectories to a location of your choosing. You can also view any nested directories inside your desired root. (You can start at your pcs root, but it might take a while!)</p>
<p>More features are currently in the works, and requests are always welcome!<p>
